## Interactions and Relationships

### User Management and Company Management

- **Relationship:**
  - The User Management context is responsible for creating and managing users. When a new user registers, they can create a new company profile within the Company Management context.
  - The User Management context assigns roles to users within the company, such as Manager or Employee.

- **Communication:**
  - The Registration Service communicates with the Company Service to create a new company profile during user registration.
  - The User Role Management component updates user roles and associations with the company.

### User Management and Employee Management

- **Relationship:**
  - The Employee Management context manages employees within a company. The User Management context handles the invitation and onboarding of new employees.
  - Employees take skill tests and their results are tracked within this context.

- **Communication:**
  - The User Management context uses the Employee Service to invite and register employees.
  - The Skill Test Management component tracks employee participation and results.

### Company Management and Employee Management

- **Relationship:**
  - The Company Management context interacts with the Employee Management context to manage employees' roles and track their activities.
  - The manager can view and update employee details and monitor their test results.

- **Communication:**
  - The Company Service communicates with the Employee Service to manage employees and their roles.
  - The Company Settings Management component ensures that company-related information is correctly associated with employees.

### Employee Management and Testing

- **Relationship:**
  - The Testing context administers skill tests to employees and collects their responses.
  - The Employee Management context tracks which employees have taken tests and stores their responses.

- **Communication:**
  - The Skill Test Management component communicates with the Test Administration Service to schedule and administer tests.
  - The Response Collection Service gathers test responses and links them to the appropriate employee profiles.

### Testing and AI Model

- **Relationship:**
  - The Testing context interacts with the AI Model context to evaluate test responses.
  - The AI Model context processes the test responses and generates skill evaluation results.

- **Communication:**
  - The Test Administration Service sends collected test responses to the Test Evaluation Service.
  - The AI Model Integration component processes the responses and returns the evaluation results.

### AI Model and Reporting

- **Relationship:**
  - The Reporting context uses the results generated by the AI Model context to create reports and analytics.
  - The AI Model provides detailed skill evaluations that feed into the reporting system.

- **Communication:**
  - The Report Generation Service retrieves evaluation results from the AI Model context.
  - The Analytics Service uses these results to create comprehensive reports.

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

- **API Calls:**
  - The frontend makes synchronous API calls to the backend services within the User Management, Company Management, Employee Management, Testing, and Reporting contexts.
  - Examples include user registration, updating company settings, inviting employees, taking tests, and fetching reports.

### Asynchronous Communication

- **Events:**
  - Certain actions, such as user registration or company creation, may trigger events that are processed asynchronously to update reports or analytics.
  - This ensures that the system remains responsive and can handle large volumes of data efficiently.
