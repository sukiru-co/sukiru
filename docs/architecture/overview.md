### Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the AI Assistant project. The goal of the project is to create an AI assistant that helps users identify their skills based on personality tests. The system allows managers to invite users, manage company settings, and view reports. This overview covers the high-level architecture, key components, design principles, and the interactions between various parts of the system.

## High-Level Architecture

The system is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is a React application that provides the user interface, while the backend is built using NestJS and TypeORM, providing the API and business logic.

### Frontend

The frontend is responsible for user interaction and includes the following key components:

- **Registration Form:** Allows new users to register and create a company profile.
- **Invite User Form:** Enables managers to invite other users to take the test.
- **Company Settings Form:** Lets managers update company information such as logo, description, and billing information.
- **Report View:** Displays reports and analytics to the manager.

### Backend

The backend handles the core business logic and API services, including:

- **Authentication Service:** Manages user registration, login, and authentication.
- **Company Service:** Handles company creation, user invitations, and management of company settings.
- **User Service:** Manages user data and roles within a company.
- **Report Service:** Generates and provides access to reports and analytics.

### Database

The system uses a PostgreSQL database to store data, including:

- **Users:** Information about users, their roles, and authentication details.
- **Companies:** Details about companies, including their settings and billing information.
- **Reports:** Data generated from user interactions and tests.

## Key Components

### 1. Registration Form

- **Purpose:** To register new users and create a company profile.
- **Fields:** Name, email, password, company name, company description, industry, logo, and billing information.
- **Validation:** Ensures all fields are correctly filled and valid.

### 2. Invite User Form

- **Purpose:** To invite new users to the platform.
- **Fields:** Email of the user to be invited.
- **Validation:** Ensures the email is valid and not already registered.

### 3. Company Settings Form

- **Purpose:** To manage and update company details.
- **Fields:** Company name, description, industry, logo, and billing information.
- **Validation:** Ensures all fields are correctly filled and valid.

### 4. Report View

- **Purpose:** To display reports and analytics to the manager.
- **Features:** Interactive charts, export options, and detailed analytics.

## Design Principles

### 1. Modular Architecture

The system is designed using a modular architecture to promote separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend. Each module handles a specific part of the functionality, such as user management or reporting.

### 2. Domain-Driven Design

The system follows domain-driven design (DDD) principles, organizing the code around the business domain. This approach ensures that the system is aligned with the business goals and terminology.

### 3. Clean Architecture

Clean architecture principles are applied to ensure that the business logic is decoupled from the frameworks and technologies. This makes the system more adaptable to change and easier to test.

### 4. Security

Security is a key consideration, with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in place. User data is protected using encryption, and sensitive operations are logged and monitored.

## Interactions

### User Registration

1. The user fills out the registration form with personal and company details.
2. The frontend validates the input and sends a request to the backend API.
3. The backend creates a new user and company, assigning the user the role of manager.
4. The user receives a confirmation and can log in to manage the company.

### User Invitation

1. The manager fills out the invite user form with the email of the new user.
2. The frontend validates the input and sends a request to the backend API.
3. The backend sends an invitation email to the new user with a registration link.
4. The new user registers and is linked to the company.

### Managing Company Settings

1. The manager accesses the company settings form and updates the information.
2. The frontend validates the input and sends a request to the backend API.
3. The backend updates the company details in the database.
4. The manager receives a confirmation of the update.

### Viewing Reports

1. The manager navigates to the report view.
2. The frontend requests the latest reports from the backend API.
3. The backend retrieves and processes the data, sending it back to the frontend.
4. The manager views the reports and can export them if needed.

## Conclusion

This architecture overview provides a high-level understanding of the AI Assistant system. The system is designed with a focus on modularity, domain-driven design, and security, ensuring a robust and maintainable platform. By following these principles and utilizing the described components, the system aims to provide a seamless and effective user experience.
