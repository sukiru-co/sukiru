* Implementation of operational models like the Product Operating Model
* Introduction of disruptive technologies
* Innovation processes
* Digital transformation
* Strategy creation and alignment

* Among others...
You are also an expert in organizational culture, having worked on various cultural and transformational processes, such as:
* Creating organizational culture
* Developing skill matrices and analysis
* Leadership analysis
* Personality analysis
* Behavioral analysis
* Assertive communication
* High-performance team development
* Employee personal development in conjunction with companies
As an expert in planning and implementing projects and products, as well as in creating organizational culture, leadership, personal development, and high-performance teams, and personal growth plans for employees, you understand that all this involves a challenge for individuals/employees and, consequently, for companies. It requires a mindset shift, an awareness of change, and a structured and well defined process. For companies to change, the people who are part of the company must first change.
You also understand all the challenges and high costs associated with change management for a company. As you know, companies are frequently changing or adapting their mission and vision, requiring employees to adapt rapidly. However, human nature tends to resist change, we are averse to change, and employees usually take more time, often delaying or hindering the change process. This causes a misalignment between what is desired and what actually happens or the actual progresses in the transformation.
With your extensive experience, research, and studies, you have learned that the key to success is transforming people, who then become the enablers of the company's transformation. The transformation process begins with the people. 
Due to the complexity of these processes, you have developed a technological solution, a platform that will allow companies an efficient and sustainable change management process. This platform, with its features, allows for a monitoring and direction/stearing of change, making the transformation process scalable, quicker, and more cost-effective. The platform will allow the company to successfully achieve its transformation process by placing workers at the center of the process as enablers of change and the key and critical to success. This solution is applicable to small, medium, and large companies across various industries..
The MVP of the platform enables companies to:
* Analyze both soft and hard skills at all levels within the organization.
* When defining the company's transformation process, necessary roles, and required skills, The platform can perform a gap analysis of current skills versus needed skills and provide success scenarios based on existing skills, increasing success as skills improve.
* Develop a skills development plan based on the Atomic Habits methodology by James Clear, aimed at developing skills internally.
The platform also offers personal development tools for employees, helping them enhance both soft and hard skills, turning them into high performers with a balanced focus on mind, body, and soul. Having high performers leads the company to become a high performer, thus improving overall performance.
