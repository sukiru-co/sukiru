# Prompt Guidelines

This directory contains documentation for the various prompts used in the Sukiru AI Assistant. Prompts are categorized based on their functionality and usage. Each category has its own subdirectory with detailed documentation.


## Introduction

This document provides guidelines for creating effective prompts to train the AI model used in the AI Assistant system. These guidelines ensure that prompts are clear, engaging, and useful for gathering relevant information from users. Following these principles will help improve the quality of interactions and the accuracy of the AI's responses.

## Guidelines for Creating Prompts

### 1. Clarity

**Description:**
Ensure that prompts are clear and easy to understand. Avoid ambiguous language and complex sentences.

**Best Practices:**
- Use simple and direct language.
- Avoid jargon or technical terms unless necessary.
- Break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions if needed.

**Example:**
```
What is your preferred method of learning new information?
a) Reading books or articles
b) Watching videos or tutorials
c) Hands-on practice
```

### 2. Relevance

**Description:**
Make sure that each prompt is relevant to the objective of the test or the information being gathered. Irrelevant questions can confuse users and lead to inaccurate results.

**Best Practices:**
- Align questions with the goals of the personality test or skill assessment.
- Avoid off-topic or filler questions.
- Tailor questions to the specific context and user profile.

**Example:**
```
How do you typically handle stress in the workplace?
a) Take a short break and relax
b) Talk to a colleague or supervisor
c) Focus on work to distract myself
```

### 3. Engagement

**Description:**
Design prompts that keep users engaged and interested. Engaging questions can improve the quality of responses and user satisfaction.

**Best Practices:**
- Use a conversational tone.
- Include varied question formats (e.g., multiple choice, open-ended).
- Provide positive reinforcement and feedback.

**Example:**
```
Imagine you are leading a team project. How would you ensure that everyone stays motivated and on track?
```

### 4. Specificity

**Description:**
Be specific in your prompts to gather precise and useful information. Vague questions can lead to unclear or unhelpful responses.

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on specific behaviors, preferences, or experiences.
- Provide clear options for multiple-choice questions.
- Use examples to clarify open-ended questions.

**Example:**
```
When faced with a tight deadline, what strategy do you use to manage your time?
a) Prioritize tasks and focus on the most important ones
b) Work longer hours to meet the deadline
c) Delegate tasks to team members
```

### 5. Brevity

**Description:**
Keep prompts concise and to the point. Long-winded questions can overwhelm users and reduce response quality.

**Best Practices:**
- Use short sentences and avoid unnecessary words.
- Limit the number of questions to avoid user fatigue.
- Get straight to the point with each question.

**Example:**
```
Do you prefer working independently or in a team?
a) Independently
b) In a team
c) A mix of both
```

### 6. Neutrality

**Description:**
Avoid leading or biased questions that may influence user responses. Neutral prompts help gather more accurate and honest answers.

**Best Practices:**
- Phrase questions in a neutral manner.
- Avoid suggesting that any answer is more desirable than others.
- Be mindful of cultural and personal biases.

**Example:**
```
What motivates you to achieve your goals?
a) Personal satisfaction
b) Recognition from others
c) Financial rewards
```

### 7. Flexibility

**Description:**
Design prompts that can adapt to different users and contexts. Flexible questions ensure that the AI can handle a wide range of scenarios and user types.

**Best Practices:**
- Use conditional logic to tailor questions based on previous responses.
- Include options for users to provide additional information or context.
- Be prepared to handle unexpected answers gracefully.

**Example:**
```
You mentioned that you prefer hands-on practice for learning. Can you provide an example of a project or task where this approach worked well for you?
```

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you can create effective prompts that enhance the user experience and improve the accuracy of the AI Assistant's responses. Clear, relevant, engaging, specific, concise, neutral, and flexible prompts will help gather valuable information from users and provide them with meaningful insights.
